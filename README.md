## Overview
As part of my internship, I had the privilege of working on the performance analysis of Shield Insurance, an insurance provider. The project involved creating a comprehensive report based on their provided data (November 2022 to April 2023). Shield Insurance extended its services to major cities such as Delhi, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Indore, and Mumbai, offering a diverse range of nine different insurance policies.
